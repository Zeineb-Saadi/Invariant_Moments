# Invariant_Moments
# What's Image Moment?
Image Moment is a particular weighted average of image pixel intensities, with the help of which we can find some specific properties of an image, like radius, area, centroid etc. To find the centroid of the image, we generally convert it to binary format and then find its center.
# Central moment 
Notice that the above central moments are translation invariant. In other words, no matter where the blob is in the image, if the shape is the same, the moments will be the same.
# Central Normalized moment 
Normalized central moments  are used  to make the central moment invariant to scale.
